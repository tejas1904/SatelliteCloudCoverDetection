Collab Notebook - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ox-GmNW0Wv794-_LJLGbUOtwaVrf9kRM?usp=sharing
create a kaggle key to directly download the dataset

# steps to run notebook
* open nootebook in goolge collab
* pre requisites required to run notebook listed in first cell in collab (instructions also listed below)
  
# instructions for collab 
* data is dowloaded directly from kaggle make sure to create a kaggle json key and place it in your google drive in  'Colab Notebooks/kaggle.json'
* if you want to create your won model just create a folder called cloudcover in you drive and run all cells
* the model save checkpints are saved directly to drive under cloudcover/
* Alternatively if you want to use pretrained download the folder cloudcover from this drive link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iK9fgNFlQKYHDRIt93P6fz0x1sD7kFYf?usp=sharing it contains pretrained model and folder split data
